industries including telecommunication automotive healthcare and smart cities members students with significant contributions project title characterization of optical attenuation due to smog for ground to ground link abstract for the past few years we have observed that the smog engulfs many parts of north punjab to a very unhealthy level and causes low visibility smog is actually a mixture of smoke and fog which has a drastic effect on the outage of the fso link now its need of the hour to study the effects of smog on optical link and how it s different from that of fog the research will be conducted to observe measurements for very particular lahore smog and present an analysis on the link margins telecom industry demands for five nines performance which refers to availability of services for 99 999 of the time currently no analytical data is present for smog attenuation and how close to five nines can this system work this ongoing research is an extension of previously completed work at graz university of technology institute of broadband communications for fog environment now the idea is to analyze system based on the same parameters for lahore s smog and compare its results with the previous conducted research on fog during experiment two independent light emitting diodes led based light sources are used operating at 850nm and 1550nm light sources uses on off

https://lhr.nu.edu.pk/fsc/research/bigdata,a big data lab has been established in lahore campus the use of big data is becoming a crucial way for leading companies to outperform their peers in most industries established competitors and new entrants alike leverage data driven strategies to innovate compete and capture value big data will help to create new growth opportunities and also entirely new categories of companies such as those that aggregate and analyze industry data students ofdr usman awaisanddr zareen alamgirhave successfully setup this lab and cluster in guidance ofdr usman awaisan openstack cloud infrastructure is also established the deployed openstack cloud provides platform as a service paas infrastructure the paas enables the students to analyze many different distributed computing technologies including data and compute clusters and grids the initial set up will be used by master thesis students and students working on their final year projects fyp it will allow the students to have a practical exposure to cloud related technologies a personalized cloud dashboard can also be made accessible over the internet in future students can access this hadoop master cluster from other labs now big data students can access the hadoop cluster for their assignments without going to the big data lab following are the students who made considerable efforts to realize the plan of setting up these labs current and past projects fuzzy clustering of mixed mode data in apache spark exploiting review helpfulness rating on scalable recommendation systems using

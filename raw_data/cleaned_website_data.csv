arshadhira khalidm azhar iqbalsaad ahmed minhassarim suhailprojecttitle characterization of optical attenuation due to smog for ground to ground linkabstract for the past few years we have observed that the smog engulfs many parts of north punjab to a very unhealthy level and causes low visibility smog is actually a mixture of smoke and fog which has a drastic effect on the outage of the fso link now its need of the hour to study the effects of smog on optical link and how it s different from that of fog the research will be conducted to observe measurements for very particular lahore smog and present an analysis on the link margins telecom industry demands for five nines performance which refers to availability of services for 99 999 of the time currently no analytical data is present for smog attenuation and how close to five nines can this system work this ongoing research is an extension of previously completed work at graz university of technology institute of broadband communications for fog environment now the idea is to analyze system based on the same parameters for lahore s smog and compare its results with the previous conducted research on fog during experiment two independent light emitting diodes led based light sources are used operating at 850nm and 1550nm light sources uses on off key modulation to driver electronic circuit while measuring

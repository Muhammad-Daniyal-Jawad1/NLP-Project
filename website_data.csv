To deal with the changes in a business environment effectively, managers require constant input from consultants, academic and professional researchers. The Center for Research on Management and Governance (CRMG) at FAST School of Management, Lahore was established with a view to bridge academic and professional knowledge on management and governance and its adaptation to suit the indigenous business environment. Jointly supervised by Dr. Hamid Hassan, Dr. Mian Muhammad Atif, Dr. Zia Khan, Dr. Ahmed Arif and Dr. Akbar Azam, the center is a hub for motivating research on the art and practice of management and governance in Pakistan. The findings from the theoretical and empirical research conducted at CRMG are expected to provide guidelines to deal with the management and governance challenges of public and private sector organizations in Pakistan.Seminars and discussions with business leaders and national & international academics are designed to facilitate sharing of ideas and providing updates on trends are a constant feature of the center. Thus the output is not just defined by producing papers but serves as the core for producing local content for inclusion in the curriculum at both graduate and undergraduate levels.Our empirical studies focus on Finance, Marketing, Motivation, Leadership, Economics, Real-Time Business plans, and a range of other topics related to management sciences. In general, the center’s research efforts are characterized by an ambition to critically and constructively study, describe and analyze the emergence and development of management & governance practices in the country. Researchers at the center aim to uphold a recognized presence in the ongoing academic discourses in crucial parts of management & governance areas. The center also undertakes consultancy projects with a number of governmental and private organizations and collaborates with other national and international universities in advancing the research.IMPORTANT LINKSCampus HomeCampus AboutAdmissionsLibrarySupport and ServicesSlateFlexDEPARTMENTSFAST School of ManagementFAST School of ComputingDepartment of Electrical EngineeringDepartment of Civil EngineeringDepartment of Sciences and Humanities© 2020 Copyright : lhr.nu.edu.pk"

Smog is actually a mixture of smoke and fog which has a drastic effect on the outage of the FSO link. Now its need of the hour to study the effects of smog on optical link and how it’s different from that of fog. The research will be conducted to observe measurements for very particular Lahore smog and present an analysis on the link margins. Telecom industry demands for five nines performance which refers to availability of services for 99.999% of the time. Currently, no analytical data is present for smog attenuation and how close to five nines can this system work. This ongoing research is an extension of previously completed work at “Graz University of Technology Institute of Broadband communications” for fog environment. Now the idea is to analyze system based on the same parameters for Lahore’s smog and compare its results with the previous conducted research on fog. During experiment, two independent light emitting diodes (LED) based light sources are used, operating at 850nm and 1550nm. Light sources uses On-Off key modulation to driver electronic circuit. While measuring data for link availability, factors like temperature and visibility are considered.ThesesPerformance Analysis of RS Encoded PPM and Self Synchronized RS Encoded PPM in FSO (2021)Comparison Analysis of log-normal, gamma-gamma and exponentiated Weibull fading model for Free Space Optical links (2020)Optical Intensity Estimation in Free Space Optical Communications Using Array of Detectors (2019)Visible Light Communications based positioning using Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) (2019) Performance Analysis of Hybrid FSO / RF System (2018)Micro-inverter Design for Islanded Micro-grid Applications (2018)Implementation of Smart Grid Features using Power Line Communications (PLC).
